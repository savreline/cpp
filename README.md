# Tutorials on C/C++

The C++ tutorials were developed to help UBC students taking the first data structures and
algorithms course in C++ to quickly get up-to-speed with to C++ after having learned Java
in an earlier course.

The C tutorials were developed to stress certain subtleties and common errors of programming
in C (for example, difficult to find memory leaks). Those tutorials are meant as a supplement
to those learning C and address specific situations rather than trying to provide a comprehensive 
introduction to the language.
